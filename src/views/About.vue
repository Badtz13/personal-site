      I started programming in around 4th grade and have was completely focused on it all the way through highschool. A year into college, a friend of mine invited me to go to
      Japan for a month in the summer. In preperation for the trip, I decided I should take a Japanese Language class so that I could at least speak a little on my trip. I loved it,
      and ended up taking a whole year's worth of class. While I still love programming and spend most of my free time working on various projects, I am mostly focusing on Japanese
      in school, as I find the classes much more interesting.
